MapReduce_Programming
=====================
Objective is to understand the principles of Distributed Computing and MapReduce in Python

A number of historical stok files are given do trades as follows,
1.Load the library into RAM. Use the MapReduce model; write a program to trade every single stock based on the following rule:
-  Buy a stock at 10am  on Tue (if the market is closed on Tue, then skip this trade)
-	Sell the shares at 12pm on Wed (if the market is close on Wed, then sell on the next trading day at 12pm)
Trade 2
2.Load the library into RAM. Use the MapReduce model, write a program to trade the stocks based on the following rule:
-	At 10am on each day, find the stock that has gained the most from market open to 10am, then buy the stock.
-	Sell the shares at 12pm on the same day.

In Conclusion I increased the number of processes and measured the execution time.
